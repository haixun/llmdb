# Databases and Large Language Models (LLMDB) 2023

### 1st International Workshop on Databases and Large Language Models at VLDB 2023

The emergent abilities of LLMs represent a turning point that is poised to significantly alter the technological and industrial landscape.

There is an urgent and exciting need to integrate relational databases and LLMs. This workshop's objective is to draw attention to this emerging topic, which has the potential to improve the performance of LLMs as well as deepen their impact in real-world applications where relational databases are used in data management.


LLMs are trained on large corpora of natural language content and provide responses in natural language, whereas databases manage structured data with a strict schema. So far, they operate in separate spaces. On the one hand, the vast amount of knowledge in relational databases is not used to train and tune LLMs, and on the other hand, relational databases are not able to access and operate on the facts contained in the LLMs.


The workshop will solicit work and facilitate discussions on the following topics.

1. How do we incorporate structured or semi-structured data into LLMs?
2. How do we model knowledge in LLMs as a database so that we can query it using SQL?
3. How do we use relational databases to improve the performance of LLMs?

### Agenda and Call for Papers

LLMDB 2023 is a half day workshop that starts on 10am, Sept 1.
